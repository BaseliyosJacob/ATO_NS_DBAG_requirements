## CENELEC Phase 1 (Concept)	Explanation
	
### 1.1 Operational Needs and Mission	"
- Textual description of operation needs and Related milestones."
	
### 1.2 Roles and Responsibilities (Actors)	"
- System context diagram (operatoin point of view) -> ibd (Internal Block Diagram)
- Definition of the Actors external to the system
- Textual description of roles and responsibilities of the Actors"
	
### 1.3 System Input/Outputs (interface with the actors)	
- Description of the Interfaces with the Actors
	
### 1.4 Operational Environment (Oops environment and contexts)	"
- Identification of the different Operational Context with the associtated Context Diagram (ibd)
- Description of the Operational Context
- Specificatoin fo the transitions between the different Operatoinal Contexts"
	
### 1.5 Non functiional specification	"
- Assumptions
- Environment conditions
- Reliability, Availability and Maintainability
- Safety
- Portability
- Performance
- Interoperability
- Interchangeability"
	
## CENELEC Phase 2 (system definition part 1 and operational context)	System Definition	
### 2.1 Functional Entities (Use Cases)	
- Identification and description of the Use Cases associated to the different Operational
Contexts (uc diagrams)
	
### 2.2 Operational Scenarios (Sequence diagramms)	
- Specification of nominal and degraded operational scenarios
- Based on Sequence Diagrams (osd)
- Stimulus-Response Specification
	
### 2.3 User Interface Principles	
- Definition of the MMI principles
- Specificaiton of the required devices (push buttons, levers, touch screen, etc...)
	
### 2.4 Logical Architecture (high level functional architecture)	
- Description of the Locial Architecture
	
### 2.5 Interfaces definition (high level with the expected level requriements FIS or FFIS)	"
- Defintion of the interfaces (internal to the sysetem) with the required standardisation level (FIS
Or FFFIS)"
